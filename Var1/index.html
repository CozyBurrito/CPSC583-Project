            The first variation is the starting point. This can be seen as a base version that is based from the sketch and attempts to 
            encapsulate the main ideas of the visualization. The range of the points’ revenues makes it quite difficult to see the differences 
            and many of the film’s are seemingly lost, which can also be seen as having too many datapoints.
