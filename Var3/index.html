            The third variation attempts to address the issue of it being difficult to really see any significant correlations between 
            the revenue and genre or even between the films. Therefore, the x axis is changed into a logarithmic scale. This helps to
            see the points that are too close together, but still keep the extremes. The main visualization is an extension of this and 
            addresses the design to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
