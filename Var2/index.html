            The second variation adds transparency to the points. This is to show the density of the points in any particular area. 
            When having many points as solid, they overlap and can be difficult to really see what information the points behind are 
            hiding. This also helps show how some films on the same x and y point can have vast differences in their ratings or runtimes.
